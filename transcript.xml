whoever I K Pop and the debate in the</text><text start="167.22" dur="4.76">general election I will be waiting there
because it&amp;#39;s such a fundamental</text><text start="171.98" dur="6.74">constitutional right way to repudiate it
in addition to the water and the effort</text><text start="178.72" dur="5.6">we need to undertake and when I&amp;#39;m
president of the tree care more about</text><text start="184.32" dur="4.9">attacking an individual&amp;#39;s right to vote
than a billionaire to write an election</text><text start="189.22" dur="5.56">it&amp;#39;s repeated that turn out and vote</text><text start="194.78" dur="7.5">whoever she sits across from in general

clinton is getting a little ahead of</text><text start="206.9" dur="6.14">yourself senator maybe she&amp;#39;s gonna have
to win the Democratic primary and caucus</text><text start="213.04" dur="4.5">process and that&amp;#39;s not the serbs I think

issue of voting rights let me just say</text><text start="234.239" dur="5.701">this I&amp;#39;m a politician I run a lot of
Elections sometimes I win both the times</text><text start="239.94" dur="5.21">when sometimes I&amp;#39;ve lost it has never
occurred to me for one second that the</text><text start="245.15" dur="4.18">way to win an election is to make it
impossible for people who disagree with</text><text start="249.33" dur="6.58">me to vote people who hold that view who
don&amp;#39;t have the guts to fight for their</text><text start="255.91" dur="5.139">ideas but we think they should win
elections by making it impossible for</text><text start="261.049" dur="4.951">people of color for poor people for old
people to vote they are cowards they are</text><text start="266" dur="5.25">political cowards who do not have the
confidence that their ideas can win and</text><text start="271.25" dur="4.5">they use simply brute force to keep
people from voting if there is anything</text><text start="275.75" dur="5.74">that I can think of that is that only
disgraceful but on american it is those</text><text start="281.49" dur="4.429">people who are trying to keep Americans
from voting we have got to stand up to</text><text start="285.919" dur="5.551">them I just introduced legislation that
calls for universal voter registration</text><text start="291.47" dur="5.12">we are way behind many other countries
in terms of making it easy for people to</text><text start="296.59" dur="4.32">register that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve got to do we
need to pass real campaign finance</text><text start="300.91" dur="4.759">reform not only overturn Citizens United
but moved to public funding of elections</text><text start="305.669" dur="4.511">I want to see america have the highest
voter turnout of any major country not</text><text start="310.18" dur="4.69">one of the lowest relative the day the
Democratic National Committee announced</text><text start="314.87" dur="5.75">its debate scheduled first debate in the
bottom two would 13 the total of six</text><text start="320.62" dur="3.789">debate what in those debates to you</text><text start="324.409" dur="6.22">you most want to debate your pondered
Secretary Clinton former governor</text><text start="330.629" dur="4.86">O&amp;#39;Malley what is the distinguishing
differences that you wanted to beat them</text><text start="335.489" dur="4.811">on and bring out to the american public
particularly democratic primary and</text><text start="340.3" dur="4.919">caucus vote but I think Secretary

social security are not cutting it I</text><text start="355.099" dur="4.35">don&amp;#39;t know that the Secretary has voiced
an opinion on that voice an opinion on</text><text start="359.449" dur="5.31">that we oppose the trans-pacific
partnership that have been opposed to a</text><text start="364.759" dur="6.13">series of disastrous trade agreements
which have cost us millions of jobs I am</text><text start="370.889" dur="4.18">strongly opposed to the Keystone

constitutional privacy rights</text><text start="396.669" dur="6.131">the secretary voted for it bottom line
though is I think that if we&amp;#39;re going to</text><text start="402.8" dur="4.719">expand the middle class if we&amp;#39;re going
to lower property if we&amp;#39;re gonna provide</text><text start="407.519" dur="5.27">health care to all americans as a right
